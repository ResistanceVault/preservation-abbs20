   Rebuilds the files "abbs:config/userfile.index" and
"abbs:config/userfile.nrindex" from the "abbs:config/userfile"
Also updates the "abbs:config/configfile" a little bit.

Use this to fix problems with bad index files. (Usually noticed
when messages get other authors or receivers etc.

It should be safe to use, but, since it's not testet all that much
please backup the files listed above just in case.

Be warned. If PUS have been used on the userfiles, checkusers will report
errors, EVEN IF THE FILES ARE OK!!!!
(This happens when Users != Maximum users).

As always, this is beta sw. Use with care. Hope it will help.
