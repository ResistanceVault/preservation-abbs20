*NOTE*

ABBS must not be running. Running FixIndex when ABBS is running has
no effect.

*NOTE*

Template: CHECK/S,KILLHIGH/S,FIXDUPLICATESNR/S,FIXDUPLICATENAMES/S
Usage:   [CHECK] [KILLHIGH] [FIXDUPLICATESNR]	[FIXDUPLICATENAMES]

[CHECK] is a NOP.

[KILLHIGH] Renames the user with to high a usernumber to "KILL ME_<nr>".
	This user should be killed imidiatly from ABBS.

[FIXDUPLICATESNR] Tries to fix duplicate usernumbers.

[FIXDUPLICATENAMES] Tries to fix duplicate names. Renames the second
	user with the same name to "KILL ME_<nr>".	This user should be killed..

Rebuilds the userfile.index and userfile.nrindex from the userfile,
and also updates the "ABBS:config/configfile" a little bit.

Use this to fix problems with bad index files. (Usually noticed
when messages get other authors or receivers etc.

It should be safe to use, but, since it's not testet all that much
please backup the files listed above just in case.


FixIndex v2.00 is for ABBS v2.x only!
