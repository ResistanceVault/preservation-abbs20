*NOTE*

ABBS must not be running. Running CryptPasswords when abbs is running has
no effect.

Converted userfiles will only work with abbs v1.1 and later. abbs 1.0 beta
will *NOT* be able to use these files.

*NOTE*

Template: USERFILE
Usage : USER=<userfile>

You must give path (if needed) and name of userfile.
eg: CryptPasswords abbs:config/userfile

If all goes well, you will have a file called abbs:config/userfile.old
and abbs:config/userfile. The .old file is the way it was before conversion.

Once a userfile is converted, you can't undo it. And, never convert a
userfile several times.
