WriteText
	- Write a text to screen/serialport
	pm_Command	= Node_WriteText
	pm_Data		= null terminated text

WriteTexto
	- Write a text to screen/serialport with newline
	pm_Command	= Node_WriteText
	pm_Data		= null terminated text

FlushSer
	- flush serial port
	pm_Command	= Node_FlushSer

WriteSerLen
	- Write a number of bytes to the serial port only
	pm_Command	= Node_WriteSerLen
	pm_Data		= text string
	pm_Arg		= string length

ReadSerLen
	- Read a number of bytes to the serial port with timeout
	pm_Command	= Node_ReadSerLen
	pm_Data		= read buffer
	pm_Arg		= number of characters to read
	pm_Arg2		= timeout in microseconds (note: 1000000 == 1 second).
			  A Timeout of 0, means read the characters in buffer
returns:
	pm_Arg		= number of characters read
	pm_Error	= PError_NoCarrier if no carrier was detected

ReadSer
	- Read a bytes from the serial port. Wait for it to arrive
	pm_Command	= Node_ReadSer

returns:
	pm_Data		= character read
	pm_Error	= PError_NoCarrier if no carrier was detected

QuitLogin
	- Tell ABBS  that frontdoor login sequence is finished
	pm_Command	= Node_QuitLogin
	pm_Arg		= Login status. 0 means frontdoor login compleate. Logoff
			  ~0 means this is a user login. Continue login sequence.
