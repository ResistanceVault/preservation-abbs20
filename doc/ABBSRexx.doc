ABBS Arexx documentation 13/07-95

*NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE*

*ALL* commands may now return an error of 20 if carrier is lost. The Arexx
program must exit imidiatly and return control to abbs.

*NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE* *NOTE*

RC = 0 means OK, anyting else is an error. High values mean severe errors

To get anything in the RESULT variable, you need to set
"options results" before the command you want to get input from.
This line is usually placed at the top of the script file.
(You only need it once)

if RC != 0, the RESULT variable is NOT filled in.

Port name : "ABBS node #x port" where x is node nr.
for node 1 : "ABBS node #1 port"

Note!!
******

If one of the input functions returns a value meaning carrier lost, user
thrown out etc, the arexx program has to exit immediatly !!

USERSETUP	<magic number>	*NOTE* this Arexx command is only callable from

						(0 = ISO, 1 = IBM, 2 = IBN,
						 3 = US7, 4 = UK7, 5 = GE7,
						 6 = FR7, 7 = SF7, 8 = NO7,
						 9 = DE7, 10 = SP7, 11 = IT7,
						 12 = MAC)
				bits 16-23: pagelength	(0 = unlimited)
				bits 12-15: scratchpadformat
						(0 = text, 1 = arc, 2 = lzh,
						 3 = zip, 4 = lha, 5 = arj,
						 6 = Zoo, 7 = Lzx)
				bits 8-11:  Transferprotocol number
						(0 = none, 1 = zmodem,
						 2 = xmodem, 3 = xmodem-CRC,
						 4 = ymodem, 5 = ymodembatch,
						 6 = ymodemG)
				bit 7 : ReadRef/Read
				bit 6 : Raw files
				bit 5 : Clear screen before messages
				bit 4 : ANSI terminal
				bit 3 : Use G&R protocol
				bit 2 : Want Color in messages
				bit 1 : Use Ansi mens
				bit 0 : Use FSE

				Puh.. That's cryptic ? :-) Here's an Example :

				Usersetup X2D('021b415f',8) will give you

				* IBN charset
				* $1b = 27 lines pr page
				* LHA scratchpad format
				* Zmodem transfer protocol
				* ReadRef
				* No raw files
				* No clearscreen
				* ANSI terminal
				* Use G&R
				* Color in messages
				* Ansi menues
				* FSE
