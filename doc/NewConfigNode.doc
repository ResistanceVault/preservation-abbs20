		       ConfigNode 2.1 Documentation
		       ============================


ConfigNode is the program that generates config files for the different
abbs nodes you want to set up for your abbs board. Normaly these config
files have an extension of .config, and they normaly reside in the
abbs:config directory. (Offcourse you can change all this).

Confignode has the ability to read old configfiles for easy modification,
or generate new ones from scratch.

When you start ConfigNode, all gadgets will be filled in with some default
values. Modify the setup as you pleases, then save the config file.
If you want to edit an old config file, just load it befor editing and
saving.

All gadgets marked with "(Accepts special characters)" accept C style
control characters \n and \r. '\n' means newline (ASCII 10), and '\r'
means carriage return (ASCII 13)

Description of all the different gadgets
****************************************

Modem init string (Accepts special characters)
=================
This is the string abbs will send to the modem each time abbs wants to reset
the modem. (Typically at startup and after each call)
The modem init string is the most difficult thing to get right, and it is very
important that it is correct. The init string will be different for different
modems. You have to read the manual to figure it out.

This string even accept the '~' special charater. When abbs encounters this character
it waits one second (per '~' character).

So, if you want to reset the modem, wait 3 seconds, then send an init string
"atz\n~~~ATS0=0&c1&d2E0X6" would do the trick.

This is abbs requirements for the modem :
	- The modem should *not* answer the phone all by it selves.
	  (Normaly S0=0 fixes this)

	- It must show the true value of CD (CD on only if the modem detects
	  carrier) (Usually &c1)

	- The modem must disconnect when DTR goes low (usually &d2)

	- The modem must not echo commands back to the machine (usually E0)

	- the modem must give a connect string of the format "Connect xxxx"
	  where xxxx is the connect speed (note. this should be the
	  modem-modem speed, *NOT* modem-machine speed) Usually the X command
	  controlls this, but sometimes other commands modifies this too)

	- The modem must give som kind of string when a ring signal is detected
	  usually this is "RING"

So, "ATS0=0&c1&d2E0X6" is an example of an init string.


Modem on hook string (Accepts special characters)
====================
When abbs wants the modem on hook again, this string is sent to the modem.
Usually this is "ATH0"

Modem off hook string (Accepts special characters)
=====================
This is the string abbs sends to the modem when abbs wants the modem to go
off hook (to make the line busy). Usually this is "ATH1"

Modem answer string (Accepts special characters)
===================
This is the string abbs sends to the modem when abbs wants the modem to answer
an incomming call. Usually this is "ATA"

Modem Dial string (Accepts special characters)
=================
Dial prefix for outgoing calls. Usually "ATDT"
Note. This string is currently not used.

Modem RING string (Accepts special characters)
=================
This is the string abbs listens for when waiting for an incomming call.
Usually "RING"

Modem CONNECT string (Accepts special characters)
====================
This it the string abbs waits for after it has sent the modem answer string
to the modem. When abbs receives this string, it collects the speed
(following the connect word), checks for a CD signal, and starts the login
sequence. Usually "CONNECT".

Modem NO CARRIER string (Accepts special characters)
=======================
The string the modem outputs after a failed dial or answer sequence. Usually
"NO CARRIER". Note, Currently not used.

Modem AT string (Accepts special characters)
===============
String used for getting the modems attension. Usually "AT"

Modem OK string (Accepts special characters)
===============
String returned from the modem if everything was ok with last command
Usually "OK"

Min Baud
========
The minimum baud speed accepted for this node. If the modem connects with
another modem with a speed less than this, the call will be terminated

Connect Wait
============
Maximum number of seconds abbs will wait after an ATA command is issued
for a "CONNECT" string to appear. If the connect string doesn't appear
withing this timeout value, abbs will abort the connection sequence.
This value must be atleast 10 seconds.

Modem-machine baud
==================
The baud speed initially used for communication between the machine and
the modem. If locked baud rate, this speed will never change.

Serial Node->Local node->Nullmodem Node
=======================================
If Serial Node is selected this is a normal external node. It will use
the serial device specified, and answer incomming calls in a normal way

If Local node is selected, this is a local node. It will not open any
serial device, and you can only logon to this node localy, using the
node window.

If Nullmodem node is selected, this modem will open the serial device
specified. You can logon by just sending a character to the serialport.
No "RING","ATA","CONNECT" sequence is used. Also, no CD cheching is done
in this node.

Comm port name
==============
Name of the serial device to use for this node. Only valid for serialnodes
and nullmodem nodes. Usually this will be "serial.device" for the internal
port and the CBM 2232 serial card, but for the GVP IOextender "gvpser.device"
is the correct string. Other serial cards may have other names.

The device selected must be compatible with serial.device (that is, accept
the same commands, and behave in the same way)

Comm port
=========
Unit number for the serial port (on the device specified in Comm port name)
to open. For the internal (an usually for the first port on a serial card)
the unit number is 0.

CTS/RTS
=======
If this is checked, the node will use the CTS/RTS hardware handshaking
(also called 7-wire) protocol. You must have this turned on if you use
locked baud rate.

*NOTE* if you turn this option on, you must also enable the CTS/RTS
protocol in the modem. (&H1 omn some modems). Most modems also require
that you set DSR always on (usually &S0). This must be added to the
modem init string (&H1&S0)

Locked baud rate
================
If this option is turned on abbs will not change the modem-machine speed
according to the connect speed.

This is the recomended way of configuring a high speed modem (9600 or more)
with compression. Use a modem-machine baud higher than the modem speed
(with compression the modem will be faster than the modem speed. For example,
a 14400 modem with compression, v42bis or something else, will give you more
than 14400 bps). For a 14400 modem, use a modem-machine baud of 19200 or
38400, and turn on CTS/RTS.

For this option to work, you must also tell the modem never to change the
modem-machine baud on its own. (Usually &B1 fixes this). The modem must
be able to support different speed between the 2 modems and modem-machine
for this to work.

+++ hangup
==========
If this option is enabled, abbs will disconnect the user by first setting
the modem in command mode (by sending '+++' to the modem), then sending
the modem on hook string.

This is not a very safe method, and it is not recomended. The only use for
this option is if the modem is unable to dropp the connection when abbs
dropps the DTR signal.

No Sleep
========
If this choise is selected, there will be no sleep disconect checking on this
node. Use with care. Only meant for non-dialup connections..

Hold Path
=========
Full path to the hold directory for this node. This is where the node will store
files used by the hold system.

*NOTE* This path must be unique. NO OTHER NODES MAY USE THE SAME PATH!!!!

Tmpdir path
===========
Full path to the temporary directory for this node. This is where the node will
store temporary files sutch as scratchpad, qwk files etc.
This directory will be created an deleted by abbs!!
(Remember, all directorys except the last one in the path must always exists.
ABBS will not creatre those! That is, if the tmppath is "t:tmp/node1tmpdir"
t:tmp must exsist, ABBS will only create (and delete) the node1tmpdir
directory)

*VERY IMPORTANT*
*NOTE* This tmppath must be unique. NO OTHER NODES MAY USE THE SAME PATH!!!!

ABBS Screen->Public screen->Default public screen
=================================================
If ABBS Screen is selected the node will open on the abbs screen (the node
will open the screen if it doesn't already exsist)

If public screen is selected, you must enter the name of an exsisting
public screen in the gadget directly to the right of the (ABBS Screen->
Public screen->Default public screen) gadget. The node will open the window
on the specified public screen (if it exsists)

If default public screen is selected, the node windo will open up on the
default public screen. (This is usually the Workbench, but need not always be)

Fullsize->Backdrop->Tiny
========================
If Fullsize is selected the node window will open according to the position
and size spesified in the window x-pos, window y-pos, height & Width
gadgets

If Backdrop is selected, the node will open a backdrop window with the full
size of the screen it opens on (well, it will leave one line on the bottom,
so you can click on the abbs screen and use the menus, if it's open on the
abbs screen, that is).

If Tiny is selected, the node will open a tiny status window at the x and y
position specified in the window x-pos & window y-pos gadgets.

Window x-pos
============
X position for the node window

Window y-pos
============
Y position for the node window

Height
======
Height of the fullscreen node window

Width
=====
Width of the fullscreen node window

Open at startup
===============
If this gadget is checked, the node will open its window when the node is
started. If it is not selected the node window will only apear when you
request it (with show in the gui)

Font
====
Allows you to choose the font used for the node window. (Use the choose file
gadget to the right of the font specification)

Set min time between two logins
===============================
Opens a separate window where you can set the minimum time (in minutes)
between to logins by the same user in a spesific hour of the day (1-24)

That means, if it's 18:27, the setting for 18 (second row, gadget nr 9)
is 5, and user foo bar logs off the system, user foo bar can not logon
to the system until 18:32. (Other users will be able to login before
18:32)

Set max login time
==================
Opens a separate window where you can set the maximum onlinetime (in
minutes) in a spesific hour of the day (1-24). If this value is less
than the users timelimit, this value will be used instead of the users
timelimit. If the user has unlimited timelimit (0), this value is not
applied at all to that user.

So, if it's 17:36,  the setting for 17 (second row, gadget nr 8) is 15,
and user foo bar logs into the system, he will be thrown out at 17:51
unless he is thrown out/logs out before that
