Resets the filedir order to a known state. Usefull if the order is in
a terrible state, so abbs can't walk the filedir list.

But, for this program to have an effect, ABBS must be down.

Another reason that abbs may stop to walk the filedir list is because of
an error in on of the .fl files. Usually it's of a wrong size.
FixFileOrder will not fix this.
