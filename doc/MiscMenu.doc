Misc Menu:

ABBS now has a misc menu where you the sysop can insert any command you
want to add to abbs. You can only add commands in the Misc menu with
Arexx scripts.

To set up Misc:
	"Makedir abbs:Misc"

To add commands to the misc menu, put arexx scripts in the abbs:Misc
directory. The name of the script determinantes the name of the command in 
the misc menu. To get a command called hello, you add a arexx script called
hello.abbs in the directory.

This is an example setup:

     abbs:Misc (dir)
       Hello.abbs

Here is the Hello.abbs file :

************* cut ***************
/* Example Arexx script for abbs
*/

options results

outimage

username
if RC >= 5 THEN DO	/* Exit if there is no user online */
	EXIT
END

tekst = '"Hi, '||result||'. This is the Misc Hello command talking to you!"'
writetext tekst
outimage

exit
************* cut ***************

That's about all there is to it.
