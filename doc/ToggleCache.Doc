This small utility enables/disenables the .fl cache in abbs.

With cache enabled, you will notice a big speed improvementon searching,
but it will cost memroy. 5000 files in the .fl files will take around 530kb of
memory for the cache.

An added bonus is that if you have cache enabled and exits abbs in a normal
way, the .fl files will be packed (old files is removed) for free.
